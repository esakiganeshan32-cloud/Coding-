Problem:
Power distribution networks, especially in urban and semi-urban areas, face frequent hazards such as wire breakages, fallen poles, and abnormal current conditions. These faults pose serious risks including electrocution, fire hazards, prolonged power outages, and delays in maintenance response. Traditional monitoring methods rely heavily on manual inspection or delayed reporting, leading to increased downtime, safety hazards, and reduced reliability of the electricity supply.
There is a critical need for an automated, real-time monitoring and auto power cut off power line safety system that can detect faults immediately, isolate the affected line safely, and notify maintenance teams promptly. Such a system must also ensure continuous monitoring even during power outages and provide actionable information to electricity board staff to improve response time and reduce hazards.

Proposed Solution:
It finds a break in the wire between the poles and sometimes the pole will fall due to disaster. Once detected, it automatically shutdown the power in that section and immediately sends an SMS to the EB using Edge level processing for quick action
